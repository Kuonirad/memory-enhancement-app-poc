# Development Process

## Hyper-Agile Methodology

Our development process follows a Hyper-Agile methodology, optimized for rapid prototyping and development within our 1-2 day timeframe. This approach emphasizes:

1. 🚀 Ultra-short sprints (2-4 hours)
2. 🔄 Continuous integration and deployment
3. 🤝 Pair programming for critical features
4. 📊 Real-time progress tracking

## Development Workflow

1. 🏗️ Setup (30 minutes):
   - Initialize React project
   - Set up version control with Git
   - Configure development environment

2. 🧱 Core Functionality (4 hours):
   - Implement basic UI components
   - Create memory exercise modules
   - Set up state management (Redux or Context API)

3. 🤖 AI Integration (3 hours):
   - Implement mock AI service for personalized learning
   - Integrate TensorFlow.js for client-side ML capabilities
   - Develop adaptive difficulty adjustment algorithm

4. 🔐 User Management (2 hours):
   - Implement user authentication (Firebase Auth)
   - Create user profile management

5. 📊 Progress Tracking (2 hours):
   - Develop data storage solution (Firebase Realtime Database)
   - Implement progress visualization components

6. 🎨 UI/UX Refinement (2 hours):
   - Enhance UI with Chakra UI components
   - Implement responsive design
   - Add animations and transitions for better user experience

7. 🧪 Testing and Debugging (2 hours):
   - Conduct unit testing with Jest
   - Perform end-to-end testing with Cypress
   - Debug and optimize performance

8. 📱 Progressive Web App (PWA) Setup (1 hour):
   - Configure service workers
   - Implement offline functionality
   - Create app manifest

## Coding Standards

- 📏 Use ESLint for code linting
- 🎨 Follow Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide
- 📝 Write clear, self-documenting code with JSDoc comments
- 🧩 Implement modular architecture for easy maintenance and scalability

## Version Control Strategy

- 🌿 Use feature branches for each major functionality
- 🔀 Implement pull requests for code review
- 🔒 Protect main branch with required reviews

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- 🤖 Use GitHub Actions for automated testing
- 🚀 Implement automatic deployment to Netlify for frontend
- 🔄 Set up automatic deployment to Heroku for backend (if applicable)

This development process is designed to maximize productivity and ensure a high-quality prototype within our tight timeframe. By leveraging modern tools and methodologies, we aim to create a robust and scalable foundation for our AI-powered Memory Enhancement Application.
