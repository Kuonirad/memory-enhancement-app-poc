## Rapid Prototyping Approach

1. 🖌️ Low-Fidelity Wireframes:
   - Use Figma for quick sketches of key screens
   - Focus on layout and user flow, not visual details

2. 🛠️ Interactive Prototype:
   - Develop using React for frontend
   - Implement basic functionality without backend integration
   - Use mock data for AI and progress tracking features

3. 🧪 User Testing:
   - Conduct quick usability tests with team members
   - Gather feedback on intuitiveness and engagement

4. 🔄 Iteration:
   - Rapidly implement changes based on feedback
   - Prioritize improvements that enhance core functionality

This design and prototyping phase focuses on creating a visually appealing and functional prototype that demonstrates the key features of our AI-powered Memory Enhancement Application. The rapid approach allows for quick iterations and improvements within our 1-2 day timeframe.
