## Rapid Prototyping Approach

### Low-Fidelity Wireframes
- Use Figma for quick sketches of key screens
- Focus on layout and user flow, not visual details

### Interactive Prototype
- Develop using React for the frontend
- Implement basic functionality without backend integration
- Use mock data for AI and progress tracking features

### User Testing
- Conduct quick usability tests with team members
- Gather feedback on intuitiveness and engagement

### Iteration
- Rapidly implement changes based on feedback
- Prioritize improvements that enhance core functionality


This design and prototyping phase focuses on creating a visually appealing and functional prototype that demonstrates the key features of our AI-powered Memory Enhancement Application. The rapid approach allows for quick iterations and improvements within our 1-2 day timeframe.
