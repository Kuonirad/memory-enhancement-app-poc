# Deployment Instructions

This guide outlines the process for deploying our AI-powered Memory Enhancement Application Prototype. We'll be using Netlify for frontend deployment and Heroku for backend deployment (if applicable).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Git installed
- Netlify CLI installed (`npm install -g netlify-cli`)
- Heroku CLI installed (if using a backend)

## Frontend Deployment (Netlify)

1. 🔧 Build the React application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. 🚀 Deploy to Netlify:
   ```bash
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```
   - Follow the prompts to authorize Netlify and select your deployment options.

3. 🌐 Configure custom domain (optional):
   - In the Netlify dashboard, go to "Domain settings"
   - Add your custom domain and follow the DNS configuration instructions

## Backend Deployment (Heroku) - If Applicable

1. 📦 Prepare your backend:
   - Ensure you have a `Procfile` in your root directory:
     ```
     web: gunicorn app:app
     ```
   - Make sure your `requirements.txt` file is up to date

2. 🔐 Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   heroku config:set KEY=VALUE
   ```

3. 🚀 Deploy to Heroku:
   ```bash
   git push heroku main
   ```

4. 🌐 Scale your dyno (if needed):
   ```bash
   heroku ps:scale web=1
   ```

## Continuous Deployment

1. 🔄 Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD:
   - Create a `.github/workflows/main.yml` file in your repository
   - Configure the workflow to run tests and deploy on push to main

2. 🔗 Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify and Heroku for automatic deployments

## Post-Deployment Steps

1. 🧪 Verify the deployment:
   - Test all features in the production environment
   - Check for any environment-specific issues

2. 📊 Set up monitoring and analytics:
   - Implement error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
   - Set up performance monitoring (e.g., New Relic)

3. 🔒 Perform a security audit:
   - Check for exposed API keys or sensitive information
   - Ensure all communications are over HTTPS

4. 📱 Test Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality:
   - Verify offline capabilities
   - Test app installation process on various devices

5. 🚀 Optimize for performance:
   - Run Lighthouse audits and address any issues
   - Implement caching strategies for improved load times

6. 📢 Prepare for user onboarding:
   - Create user guides or tooltips
   - Set up a feedback collection mechanism

By following these deployment instructions, you'll have your AI-powered Memory Enhancement Application Prototype up and running in a production environment, ready for user testing and further refinement.
